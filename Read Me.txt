Image -> Ascii Art, By Arvinder Sehmi (Arvinder@Sehmi.org.uk)

This App Will Load An Image, Automatically Resize  And Grey Scale It.
It Will Then Create A Copy Of The Image, But Not Using Pixels, using Text!
The Created Images Are Best Viewed In The Font TERMINAL, Or In A Dos Window.

If You Save Them, Load The Up In Notepad With The Font TERMINAL.
(To Change Notepad's Font, Goto Edit, Then Set Font. 
Goto TERMINAL in The List, And Set The Size To 9)
